## About Me
I recently earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University, transitioning from over a decade in various industries to pursue my passion for technology. I developed a strong interest in low-level programming, particularly Operating Systems and Embedded Systems, while also refining my Object-Oriented Design skills as a Teaching Assistant and through my capstone project. Additionally, I explored Computer Vision, working with large datasets for Object Detection and Identification. With a diverse background and solid software development skills, I’m eager to contribute to innovative, impactful projects.

## Current Projects
My primary focus is securing a role where I can apply the skills I developed during my coursework. In the meantime, I am exploring large datasets and deepening my understanding of Artificial Intelligence, with a goal of bridging the gap between my low-level, systems-based knowledge and a higher-level, data-driven approach to AI and machine learning.
