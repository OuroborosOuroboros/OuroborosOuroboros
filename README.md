## About Me
I recently earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University after spending over a decade gaining professional experience across multiple industries. Driven by a passion for technology, I made the decision to change careers and pursue Computer Science.

During my time at Northeastern, I developed a strong interest in low-level programming, particularly in Operating Systems and Embedded Systems, where I found great satisfaction exploring the intersection between hardware and software. I also enjoyed Object-Oriented Design, reinforcing my skills both as a Teaching Assistant and through my capstone project, where I collaborated with a team to develop an administrative suite for Palaver Music Center, a local nonprofit music school.

Additionally, I explored Computer Vision, where I was introduced to training models on large datasets, focusing on Object Detection and Object Identification. With a diverse background and a strong foundation in software development, I am eager to apply my skills to innovative and impactful projects.

## Current Projects
My primary focus is securing a role where I can apply the skills I developed during my coursework. In the meantime, I am exploring large datasets and deepening my understanding of Artificial Intelligence, with a goal of bridging the gap between my low-level, systems-based knowledge and a higher-level, data-driven approach to AI and machine learning.
